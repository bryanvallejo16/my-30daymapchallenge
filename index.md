### Welcome
### My 30DayMapChallenge 2021

The initiative of #30DayMapChallenge was created by Topi Tjukanov and the official website is [30daymapchallenge.com/](https://30daymapchallenge.com/).

I couldn't manage to do all 30 maps but as far as I could I used my time to create maps. I discovered that everyday is a good to do a map.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bryanvallejo16/my-30daymapchallenge/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
